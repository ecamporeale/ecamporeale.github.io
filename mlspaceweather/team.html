		 </div>	

<p style=line-height:1.5em; align="justify">With a background in maths (Ecole Normale Supérieure), Michèle Sebag went to industry (Thalès) where she started to learn about computer science, project management, and artificial intelligence. She got interested in AI, became consulting engineer, and realized that machine learning was something to be. She was offered the opportunity to start research on machine learning for applications in numerical engineering at <a href="http://www.lms.polytechnique.fr/">Laboratoire de Mécanique des Solides at Ecole Polytechnique</a>.</p>
<p>After her PhD at the crossroad of machine learning (<a href="http://www.lri.fr/">LRI, Université Paris-Sud Orsay</a>), data analysis (<a href="http://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/">Ceremade, Université Paris-10 Dauphine</a>) and numerical engineering (<a href="http://www.lms.polytechnique.fr/">LMS, Ecole Polytechnique</a>), she entered CNRS as research fellow (CR1) in 1991. In 2001, she took the lead of the Inference and ML group, now ML &amp; Optimization, at LRI, Université Paris-Sud. In 2003 she founded together with <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~marc/">Marc Schoenauer</a> the TAO (ML &amp; Optimization) <a href="http://www.inria.fr/">INRIA</a> project.</p>
<p>Her research interests include reinforcement learning, preference learning, information theory for robotics and surrogate optimization.</p>

		 </div>	

<p style=line-height:1.5em; align="justify">Cyril Furtlehner is a permanent research member of the Inria Saclay project-team TAO. Originally trained in theoretical physics, holding a Phd of Paris VI University dealing with quantum disordered systems, he eventually joined first the Inria team PREVAL in Rocquencourt to work on stochastic processes and more applied research themes like the self organization of a fleet of automated vehicles.
After being hired in the TAO team, his scientific interests shifted to interdisciplinary subjects concerning statistical physics problems related to machine learning, optimization and traffic inference, as well as stochastic particle processes related to microscopic traffic modeling. Recent activities are focusing on inverse Markov random field problems for large scale inference algorithms developments.</p>

		 </div>	

<p style=line-height:1.5em; align="justify">Dr Shprits' primarily area of scientific research is understanding the dynamics of the radiation belts and their effect on satellites. Dr Shprits has developed codes to quantify the dynamical evolution of the radiation belts. He has also developed codes to quantify quasi-linear scattering rates due to wave-particle interactions. He has quantified the effects of scattering by ELF/ VLF and ULF waves and identified a number of critical effects associated with radial diffusion, local acceleration and loss of the radiation belt electrons.</p>
